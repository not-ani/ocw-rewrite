					Our goal is to provide the best possible learning experience for

					empower students by creating high-quality resources for students to
					learn from and engage with.

				<p className="leading-relaxed">
					We <strong className="text-bold"> NEVER </strong> publish teacher
					created content without prior review and approval from that teacher,
					nor do we share any answers to homework or assessments. All resources
					in the platform are aimed at supporting student learning and
					engagement. Life at Creek is hard and we understand that students are
					tempted to cheat. We have implemented strict policies to prevent any
					form of pedagogical emparment

					We would love to work with you!

				<p>
					As socioeconomic gaps continue to widen in the world, we cannot let
					access to high quality education be limited by financial barriers. We
					are committed to providing resources and support to all students,
					regardless of their background or circumstances. We believe that
					education is a fundamental right and that everyone deserves the
					opportunity to learn and grow.
					<br />
					<br />
					Students benefit from our platform by having access to high-quality
					resources and support to help them succeed in their studies. We are
					willing to work with you to create high-quality resources for students
					to learn from and engage for your class.
