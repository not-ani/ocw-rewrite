# Adding Courses

At the top of the **Courses** tab on the Admin Page, you’ll see two buttons above the course table: **Fork Course** and **Add Course**. These are your two main options for creating courses on your Open Courseware site.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork Course">
    The **Fork Course** option allows you to duplicate a course from another school’s Open Courseware site.

    This feature exists because some classes share overlapping material.\
    For example, many **AP Calculus** courses cover similar topics. Forking lets your writers quickly reuse content from another site and then adjust it to match your school’s specific curriculum.

    <Tip>
      Use Fork Course to save time and maintain consistency across similar subjects.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Course">
    The **Add Course** button provides a simpler way to start from scratch.\
    You can create a new course by entering a course name and description.

    <Check>
      Use Add Course when you want to build a course entirely tailored to your school’s needs.

# Adding content to courses

## Permissions system

Before adding new units or lessons to your site, it's important to understand how **permissions** work on the Open Courseware platform.

## Permissions

The Open Courseware system uses two levels of permissions:

1. **Sitewide permissions**, which are controlled through the **Admin Page**
2. **Course-level permissions**, which determine what users can do inside a specific course

Giving every user the ability to edit every course would be insecure. To prevent this, course-specific permissions allow admins to give users different roles within each course.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing the course dashboard">
    Go to the **Courses** page and click the **Edit** button in the bottom right corner of a course.\
    This opens the **Course Dashboard**, where you’ll find a **Users** tab on the sidebar.

    Click **Users** to view everyone who currently has access to that course.\
    You can also add new users and assign them a role — **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understanding course roles">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Course Admin">
        A **Course Admin** can edit everything about that course.\
        They can delete or rename the course, update all its content, and manage other users.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Editor">
        An **Editor** can create, edit, and delete **units** and **lessons** but cannot change the course configuration itself.\
        Most of your content writers will be editors.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Viewer">
        A **Viewer** can only view everything within the course dashboard.\
        This role is rarely used but can be helpful for demonstrating features or reviewing content.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Units

Each course is organized into **units**, which group lessons under related topics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a unit">
    From your **Course Dashboard homepage**, click the **Create Unit** button.\
    You’ll be asked to provide:

    - A **unit name**
    - An **optional description**
    - Whether the unit should be **published**

    If a unit is **published**, anyone on the internet can view it.\
    If it’s **unpublished**, only course admins and editors can see it inside the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Editing a unit">
    Once a unit is created, it appears in the units table.\
    Clicking a unit takes you to its own page, where you can:

    - View all lessons in that unit
    - Update unit details such as name, description, or publish status
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  You’ve now set up your course structure with organized units ready for lessons.
</Check>

## Lessons

Each **unit** contains one or more **lessons**. Lessons may include text, videos, PDFs, or embedded content from other sources.

At the top of a unit’s page, you’ll find a **Create Lesson** button above the lessons table.\
Click it to open a form where you can enter information about your lesson.

One key field is the **Embed URL or iFrame** field. This determines **how** your content appears on the website.

To reduce hosting costs and make it easy to include existing notes or media, you can embed lessons directly from platforms such as **Google Docs**, **YouTube**, or **Google Drive (for PDFs)**.
