The **Admin Page** helps you manage your entire Open Courseware website.  
If you can see this page, it means you have full administrator permissions and can perform any action available on the platform.

Once you’re logged in as an admin, you’ll notice an **admin icon** next to your profile picture. Clicking this icon takes you to the admin page.

The admin page includes three main sections: **Courses**, **Site Content**, and **Logs**.

<Steps>

<Step title="Courses tab">
The **Courses** tab lists every course currently on the site. You can publish or unpublish courses from here with a single click.

You can also view and manage the list of current site administrators.

<Warning>
Adding new administrators gives them full access to the site, allowing them to perform any action and bypass non-admin restrictions.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Site Content tab">
The **Site Content** tab manages all content on the site that isn’t part of a course. This includes your site’s name, logo, social media links, and contributor information.
</Step>

<Step title="Logs tab">
The **Logs** tab records every action taken by every user. You can filter and search these records to see what editors and admins have done.

<Tip>
Use the Logs tab to track changes and maintain accountability among your content team.
