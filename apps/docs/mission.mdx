As education inevitably becomes increasingly commodified, socioeconomic disparities yield outsized impacts over student outcomes.

\
The OpenCourseWare Project (OCW) is dedicated to providing free, high-quality resources to students all around the world and to help bridge these gaps in education.

Our work focuses on two main areas:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Platform Development">
    We build and maintain a **multi-tenant, school-agnostic platform** that enables institutions to share educational resources easily—without requiring technical expertise.\
    This infrastructure allows schools to publish, manage, and collaborate on courses seamlessly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Community and Outreach">
    We actively work to expand our reach by bringing more schools into the network and fostering local learning communities.\
    This includes managing social media, coordinating with administrators, and supporting the participation of educators and students.
