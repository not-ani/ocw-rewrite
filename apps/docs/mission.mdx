# Our Mission

As education inevitably becomes increasingly commodified, socioeconomic disparities yield outsized impacts over student outcomes.  
The OpenCourseWare Project (OCW) is dedicated to providing free, high-quality resources to students at Cherry Creek High School to help bridge these gaps in education. 
Our platform offers a wide range of courses, notes, and tools to help students achieve their academic goals.
Creek OCW’s goal is facilitating the larger proliferation of high quality educational material. In doing so we hope to heighten the character of our academics, accelerate the pace of our learning, and deepen the level of our understanding.
